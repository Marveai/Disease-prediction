Disease Detector

Overview

The Disease Dectector is a machine Learning project designed to pridict disease based on patient health data. The model is trained using classification techniques to anaalyze/medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics

This project is implemented in Python with goggle colab and leverages machine learning libraries for training and evaluation

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning for health-related datasets
Training ML models for disease prediction
Model evaluation with accuray and metrics
Sorting trained model for reuse
Easy_to_use Interface via Jupyter Notebook

Technologies used

Python 3.x
Numpy, Pandas - Data handling
Scikit_learn - Machine learning algorithms
Matplotlib, Seaborn - Visualization
Joblib - Model persistence

Craeate and activates a virtual environment(recommended): python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Linux\Mac venv\ Scripts \activate # On Windows

install dependencies: pip install -r requirement.txt

Open Colab notebook:

Run the Disease_Detector.ipynb file step by step
Train the model and generate predictions.

Example Workflow Load Dataset Process data Train ML model(Random Forest/Logistic Regression/etc.) 
Evaluate accuracy,confusion matrix Save trained model for later usage

Future improvement Build a Streamlit Web App for user_friendly interaction
